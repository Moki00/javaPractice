		 * cursor can jump forward. The algorithmï¿½s purpose is to determine if it is
		 * possible to reach the end. IE: The array [3,2,1,0,4] would return false. The
		 * array [2,0,1,1,4] would return true.
		 * 
		 * Bonus: Alter the algorithm to return an integer value for the least possible
		 * number of jumps. If it is not possible to reach the end, return -1.
